# iPhone Sensor Visualization

This project displays real-time sensor data from an iPhone's accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer in a web interface.

## Features

- Real-time visualization of sensor data
- Displays data from three sensors:
  - Accelerometer (measures acceleration forces in G)
  - Gyroscope (measures rotation in radians/second)
  - Magnetometer (measures magnetic fields in microTesla)
- Live updating graphs and numerical displays

## Project Status
Currently in development. Next steps:
- Setting up web interface
- Implementing data transmission from iPhone to webpage
- Creating real-time visualization

## Built With
- React Native (iPhone app)
- React (web interface)
- Expo

## Development Setup
Instructions for setup will be added as development progresses.
